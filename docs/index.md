# Torch.js Documentation

## What is it?

Torch.js, or 'Torch' is an honest attempt at creating an HTML5 game development
framework. Are there better tools out there? Maybe, but I made this one.

## Overview

Torch basically revolves around two main components: [Sprites](sprites.md) and [Games](games.md)

Games are the containers of a Torch game (weird, huh?) and Sprites are the things inside of it.
See the respective docs for more details.
