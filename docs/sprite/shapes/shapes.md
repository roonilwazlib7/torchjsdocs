# Shapes

## Overview
Shapes are a kind of primitive sprite. They all inherit from the sprite class,
but they are displayed differently.

They can be accessed from Torch.Shapes:
```coffeescript
    circle = new Torch.Shapes.Circle()
    # .. etc
```

Here they are:

* [Circles](circle.md)
* [Lines](line.md)
